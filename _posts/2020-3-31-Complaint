People are way too arrogant nowadays. They don’t listen, they never listen. They don’t have any ethics. Their ethics and moral are existing for the sake of efficiency and preservation. No one actually cares. They just cares so that they don’t have to care. If you can propose some plan that Make them don’t have to care even without actually doing anything, they will gladly accept your solution and move on with the thought that they are caring people. They are too selfish, they shout utilitarianism when they take advantage of other and humanism when they’re being taken advantage. Just shut the fuck up. In most cases, they look for rationale rather than answers. Maybe that’s why progress is slowed? What’s utmost disgusting is their inauthenticity and pretend-innocence. No one is innocent, everyone is responsible.
